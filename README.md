# NLP Basics

## Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is a field within artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling machines to process, interpret, and even generate human language. NLP bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding, allowing machines to interact with humans in ways that feel natural and intuitive. Through NLP, computers can perform tasks like responding to queries in chatbots, analyzing emotions in sentiment analysis, translating languages, summarizing documents, and much more.

However, NLP is challenging because human language is inherently complex and nuanced. Words can have multiple meanings depending on the context—an issue known as polysemy. For instance, the word "bank" can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river, depending on usage. Language is also filled with ambiguities, where the same sentence can be interpreted in different ways. Additionally, humans rely on vast amounts of background knowledge and context to understand language accurately, something machines find difficult to replicate. These challenges make NLP a complex yet fascinating field, pushing researchers to design models that capture these subtle aspects of human language.

## Key Steps in NLP

To turn raw text data into actionable insights, NLP relies on a series of essential steps: **Text Preprocessing**, **Feature Extraction**, and **Model Training & Evaluation**. Each step prepares text data in a way that allows machines to interpret and analyze it effectively.

- **Text Preprocessing** is the first step, focused on cleaning and standardizing text data. Tokenization splits sentences into smaller units, or "tokens," which can be individual words or subwords, making the text manageable for analysis. Stopword removal filters out common words like "the" and "is," which often do not add significant meaning but can create noise in the data. Stemming and lemmatization reduce words to their root forms, such as converting "running" to "run," creating consistency across similar words.

- **Feature Extraction** converts text into a numerical format that can be processed by machine learning models. Several techniques accomplish this. The Bag-of-Words model counts the frequency of each word in the text, providing a straightforward representation of word occurrences. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) adds context by measuring the importance of words across multiple documents, highlighting keywords specific to each document. Word embeddings, like **Word2Vec**, go a step further by encoding words into vectors that capture context and relationships between words, helping models understand meanings and similarities.

- **Model Training & Evaluation** builds and tests NLP models to perform specific tasks, such as sentiment analysis or language translation. The data is typically split into training and testing sets, where the training data helps the model learn patterns, and the testing data evaluates its performance. Different models, like neural networks or decision trees, may be selected depending on the complexity and requirements of the task. The model’s performance is then assessed using metrics like accuracy or F1-score, providing insight into how well the model can interpret and predict based on the text data.

Each of these steps plays a crucial role in converting raw text into a structured format that allows machines to extract insights, power applications, and interact with human language.

## Tokenization Basics in NLP

Tokenization is a foundational process in NLP, where text is broken down into smaller, manageable units called "tokens." These tokens are the building blocks that enable NLP models to understand and process language. Tokenization simplifies the text by converting it into a structured format, making it easier for models to analyze, interpret, and extract meaning from the data.

- **Word Tokenization**: Text is split into individual words, e.g., "Natural language processing" becomes ["Natural," "language," "processing"].
- **Sentence Tokenization**: Text is split into complete sentences, which is useful for applications requiring context at the sentence level, e.g., "Hello. How are you?" becomes ["Hello.", "How are you?"].
- **Subword or Character Tokenization**: Words are broken into smaller sub-units, like prefixes, suffixes, or characters, valuable for handling rare and unknown words, e.g., "running" becomes ["run", "ning"].

Tokenization is essential because it lays the groundwork for further text analysis. By converting text into tokens, it transforms unstructured language into a structured format that machine learning models can understand, preparing the data for analysis and helping models capture language structure and meaning more accurately.

## BERT and Contextual Embeddings

1. **BERT's Context Understanding**: BERT understands context by analyzing the words surrounding each target word, allowing it to grasp true meanings across different contexts. For instance, it distinguishes "bank" in "I deposited money in the bank" (financial institution) from "riverbank."

2. **Transformers**: BERT’s architecture is based on Transformers, using self-attention mechanisms to understand relationships between words. Self-attention allows each word to “pay attention” to others, helping the model understand dependencies regardless of their position. BERT, a modification of the Transformer model, achieves deeply bidirectional text understanding.

3. **Applications**: BERT’s contextual embeddings make it effective for transfer learning. It can be pre-trained on large amounts of text data and fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and text classification.

## Comparison of Word2Vec and BERT

While both Word2Vec and BERT aim to capture semantic relationships among words, they differ in their approach to tokenization, embedding generation, and computational complexity.

### Tokenization Approach

- **Word2Vec**: Processes each word as a discrete token, treating each word as a single, inseparable unit.
- **BERT**: Tokenizes at the sub-word level, breaking words into smaller components, such as morphemes, allowing BERT to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words effectively.

### Embedding Nature

- **Word2Vec**: Produces static embeddings, meaning each word has a fixed vector representation across all contexts, suitable for efficient similarity searches and clustering.
- **BERT**: Generates contextual embeddings, assigning different vector representations to the same word based on surrounding text, capturing nuanced meanings for deep language comprehension.

### Computational Complexity and Model Architecture

- **Word2Vec**: A shallow neural network, computationally lightweight, suitable for tasks with less context.
- **BERT**: A multi-layered Transformer model designed to capture syntactic and semantic information across multiple layers, though more computationally intensive.

### Applications

- **Word2Vec**: Ideal for similarity searches, basic text clustering, and preprocessing for sentiment analysis.
- **BERT**: Effective for question answering, translation, and text summarization due to its understanding of overall context.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, NLP bridges the gap between human communication and machine understanding, enabling computers to process, interpret, and generate human language. Core techniques like tokenization, which breaks down text into manageable units, and embedding, which converts these tokens into numerical representations, transform raw text into actionable insights, powering applications from sentiment analysis to language translation.

While traditional models like Word2Vec provide static embeddings ideal for straightforward, similarity-based tasks, advanced models like BERT use contextual embeddings through bidirectional Transformers, capturing nuanced meanings based on context. Together, these models illustrate how NLP advances human-computer interaction by making language comprehension more accessible and intuitive.
